# lab1_cipher
**You are a spy, and want to transform your message into something that your enemy cannot read if it is intercepted, but headquarters can still read. You need a Cipher!**

**A cipher (or cypher) is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption—a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure.**

**Specifically, let’s implement a ceasar cipher: a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.**

1. Ask clarifying questions (10 pts)
2. Walk through an example (5 pts)
3. List  edge cases(10 pts)
4. Describe approach as you would to a little cousin who does not know anything about computer science terms (15 pts)
5. Based off your description, identify keywords that hint what ds&a you should use in your implementation (5 pts)
6. [individually] Write Code (30 pts)
    1. Add comments describing what the code does 
    2. Check that your tests pass
    3. Handle edge cases
7. write 3 tests that involve your edge cases described above  (15 pts)
8. Followup Problem: You are at headquarters, and receive an encrypted message. You know the number by which it has been shifted. Write a method to decrypt it (10 pts).
9. Bonus Problem 1: You intercepted a message from your enemy, who also uses cesar ciphers. What does it say? How much was it shifted by?

10. Bonus Problem 2: That doesn't seem all that secure does it? You only have to check 26 options. Implement encode/decode methods in such a way that it would be harder to decode by an enemy. What information would both the encoder and decoder need to know? How many options would a enemy who interecepted need to check?

Possible ideas include
* Instead of shifting, each letter transforms to a predefined ordering  (or permutation) of the characters
* Instead of the lowercase alphabet, each letter transforms to any charachter
* Advanced: Implement an [RSA encryption](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_algorithm)
